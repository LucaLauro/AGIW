the shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables: the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter, opening and closing. these two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. this is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. the term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. for example, a setting of 1/60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. usually, a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene, for motion shots, while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused, abstract result.","white balance presets (6), custom white balance, auto, preset (daylight, shade, cloudy, tungsten light, white fluorescent light, flash), custom, colour temperature setting",1
