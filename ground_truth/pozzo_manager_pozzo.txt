You\'ll still find the ease of operation, superior features, and unique quality that you trust with Canon PowerShot S300 Digital ELPH.The stainless steel-bodied S300 defines luxury and sophistication. Its ultra-compact design employs the latest optical technology. In fact, Powershot S300 is the world\'s smallest digital camera with a retractable, optical 3x zoom lens. The more powerful light guide flash, the new digital signal processing IC/CPU, and LCD monitor run more efficiently, requiring only a compact Li-Ion battery. This all boils down to a camera that\'s stronger, smarter, faster, yet more compact. You want your pictures to look their best, right? Well, quality pays. Canon technology gives the S300 a 1/2.7 inch type, 2.11 megapixel CCD, able to record a 1600x1200 pixel image. That\'s the resolution you need for a high-quality 8"x10" (20cm x 25cm) print. A new design for the ultra-compact and fully retractable zoom lens offers high resolution and low distortion. Used with the IC processing signal, the digital zoom smoothly engages to fill your frame with detailed, clear images up to the equivalent of a 265mm lens for 35mm format cameras. There\'s a macro mode, too; so, take pictures from far and wide, tight and close. Connect the cable to the optional Canon CP-10 Card Photo printer, put S300 into direct print mode, and you\'re there. With a resolution of 300x300 dpi, you\'ll get brilliant credit card-sized prints. Pick your preferred print settings, and you\'ll have the prints in mere seconds. With the new digital signal processing IC working in conjunction with the primary color filter, Powershot S300 ensures that each photo shows its true colors, in every shooting situation. Canon advances in technology provide improvements governing optimum exposure, resolution, and color temperatures to virtually guarantee accuracy with the AE control system and various white-balance settings (6 total including black-and-white). Different situations demand their own needs. S300 offers nine different image quality combinations. For best results, select Superfine mode to lower the compression ratio and hold onto image detail sufficient for business purposes. Sometimes you want more than one shot. Record a movie clip to see every frame of that game-winning goal or basket. S300 can record movie clips at 20 frames per second in three pixel modes, for up to 30 seconds, maximum.

18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM Lens Kit\nOVERVIEWFEATURESDesigned with a penchant for speed, the EOS 7D Mark II DSLR Camera from Canon is characterized by its APS-C-sized 20.2MP CMOS sensor, dual DIGIC 6 image processors, and a top continuous shooting rate of 10 fps. Both a 65-point all cross-type phase-detection AF system and Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology benefit fast, accurate focusing performance for both optical viewfinder and live view shooting. Additionally, the combination of the dual image processors along with the CMOS sensor also contribute to enhanced low-light sensitivity to a native ISO 16000, which is further expandable to ISO 51200. The 7D Mark II comfortably performs in a range of challenging situations, and while ideally situated as a tool for sports and wildlife photographers, it resides equally as well in the hands of contemporary multimedia image-makers.\nIncluded with the 7D Mark II is the EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM lens, which provides a 35mm-equivalent focal length of 28.8-216mm. Covering a range of perspectives from wide-angle to telephoto-length, this lens is a highly versatile tool for use in everyday situations for both still image and movie recording. Its design integrates an STM stepping motor that provides near-silent focusing abilities with smooth and precise control. Additionally, the optical image stabilization system helps to minimize the appearance of camera shake by up to four shutter speed steps in order to benefit working in low-light conditions and with greater zoom magnifications. One PMO (precision molded optics) aspherical lens element and one UD (ultra-low dispersion) element are also incorporated into the lens construction to help reduce chromatic aberrations throughout the zoom range and an optimized lens coating has been applied, too, in order to lessen lens flare and ghosting for higher contrast, clearer imagery.20.2MP APS-C CMOS Sensor\nDual DIGIC 6 Image Processors\n3.0" 1.04m-Dot Clear View II LCD Monitor\nFull HD 1080p/60 Video & Movie Servo AF\nDual Pixel CMOS AF with Live View\n65-Point All Cross-Type AF System\nNative ISO 16000, Extended to ISO 51200\nContinuous 10 fps Shooting\nMagnesium Alloy Body Construction\nBuilt-In GPS Receiver & Digital Compass\nINSIDE THE PACKAGECanon EOS 7D Mark II Digital SLR Camera + EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM Lens Kit * For environmental friendly reason, instruction BOOK Manual may or may not be supplied.

Both a 65-point all cross-type phase-detection AF system and Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology benefit fast, accurate focusing performance for both optical viewfinder and live view shooting. Additionally, the combination of the dual image processors along with the CMOS sensor also contribute to enhanced low-light sensitivity to a native ISO 16000, which is further expandable to ISO 51200. The 7D Mark II comfortably performs in a range of challenging situations, and while ideally situated as a tool for sports and wildlife photographers, it resides equally as well in the hands of contemporary multimedia image-makers.\nIncluded with the 7D Mark II is the EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM lens, which provides a 35mm-equivalent focal length of 28.8-216mm.

It features a new, ultra fast f/2.0 aperture 4.x optical zoom lens, along with a 4 Mega Pixel primary color CCD and Canon\'s unique high-performance DIGIC processor.The PowerShot G3 is equipped with a compact and fast 4x optical zoom lens with a focal length of 7.2 to 28.8mm (35-140mm equivalent in 35mm format) and a fast maximum aperture range of f2.0 (W) to f3.0 (T). Made up of 8 elements in 7 groups, the lens focusing is controlled from the rear by moving just one element. This means that focusing is fast and consumes very little power.RAW mode allows you to obtain original image data, recording the image direct from the CCD without any image processing. With RAW mode images, you can alter and set the parameters of image before being saved or transferred to the PC. A loss-less (reversible) compression method for RAW image capture is used (as opposed to the non-reversible compression formats of JPEG), allowing all the original data to be retrieved from the CompactFlash card. It also has the advantage of requiring approximately 40% less space than a totally uncompressed image, with no loss in quality.3 Exposure Modes include Center weighted average, Evaluative and Spot. Center weighted average measures light from the entire image but weights the metering in favor of the center portion. With the Evaluative mode, the image is divided into a number of blocks and the image is evaluated to determine the subject, brightness, if it is front/back lit and selects the appropriate exposure. Using the Spot mode light is measured from a specific point of the image. The spot metering point can be either fixed to the center or linked to the currently selected focusing point.There is no \'step\' drop in resolution as the camera enters the digital zoom function. The optical zoom is used as far as possible, to the limit of the telephoto end (105mm in 35mm format), at which point the digital zoom function will operate, gradually reducing the CCD reading area until it reaches the final center portion.12 EOS-based picture-taking modes include two NEW custom modes, manual, Av, TV, Program, Auto, Portrait, Landscape, Night Scene, Stitch Assist and Movie mode.Since the aperture and shutter mechanisms are now separate devices, the PowerShot G3 can use a greater variety of aperture/shutter combinations than the PowerShot G2, allowing for greater photographic flexibility. The PowerShot G3 can now achieve a shutter speed of 1/1250th sec at max aperture f2.0 - f3.0 (compared to 1/500th sec from the G2). Conversely, to achieve a shutter speed of 1/2000th sec, the maximum aperture is f4.0 - f5.6.Continuous Shooting Modes include High Speed and Normal. Choosing the \'speed priority\' mode will allow the camera to shoot a number of shots at a very fast rate, however, this very fast burst rate can only be sustained for a small number of shots. (Approx. 1.5 images/sec for a maximum of 14 images at this speed). Choosing the \'quantity priority\' mode will allow the camera to shoot a larger number of shots than in the \'speed priority mode\' in quick succession, but is slower. This mode shoots at a similar rate to the PowerShot G1 in continuous shooting mode. (Approx. 2.5 images/sec for a maximum of 14 images at this speed)Interval Shooting are selectable from the menu system (P, Tv, Av, M, C modes). Multiple of 1-minute intervals for up to 60 minutes; maximum of 100 shots (depending on capacity of CF card).The PowerShot G3 allows the user to select the camera\'s ND filter. When selected, an ND8 (or 0.9) filter is placed over the sensor, internally within the camera, reducing the amount of light reaching the sensor without affecting the color balance. This is especially useful in very bright conditions where a slow shutter speed/large aperture is required or when using a flash in very close, macro photography.A tiny sensor has been incorporated into ...\nProduct Highlights Video\nProduct Identifiers BrandCanon ModelG3 MPN8120A013\nKey Features Camera TypePoint & Shoot Optical Zoom4x Digital Zoom3.6x Sensor Resolution4.0 MP Screen Size1.8"\nOptical Sensor Sensor Size1/1.8" Sensor TypeCCD\nLens System Macro Focus Range5-50cm Focus AdjustmentAutofocus & Fixed Focus & Manual, Automatic, Manual Auto Focus typeTTL contrast detection Focal Length Equivalent to 35mm Camera34 - 140mm\nExposure Max Shutter Speed1/2000 sec Min Shutter Speed15 sec Exposure compensationÂ±2 EV range, in 1/3 EV steps Exposure MeteringCenter-Weighted, Evaluative, Spot Exposure ModesAperture-Priority, Automatic, Manual, Program, Shutter-Priority Light SensitivityISO 100, ISO 200, ISO 400, ISO 50 Light Sensitivity Max400\nCamera Flash Flash TypeBuilt-in flash Red Eye ReductionYes Effective Flash Range0.7 m - 5 m Camera Flash FeaturesAuto Flash, Fill-in Flash, Flash +/- Compensation, Flash Off, Red-eye Reduction Flash Flash ModesAuto Mode, Fill-in Mode, OFF mode, Red-eye Reduction\nMemory / Storage Supported Flash MemoryCompactFlash Card Type I, CompactFlash I, CompactFlash II Floppy Drive StorageNone\nViewfinder Viewfinder TypeOptical, Optical (Through-the-lens) Optical Viewfinder TypeReal-image zoom Viewfinder - Field Coverage83% Dioptric Correction Range-3 to +1\nDimensions Depth2.5 in.

Also, with DIGIC II, higher resolution and high-speed processing were achieved and the startup time and response time were shortened.This camera is equipped with a 12x optical zoom lens, which covers a 35mm film equivalent focal length ranging from 36 mm (Wide Angle) to 432 mm (Telephoto), and has an f/2.7 (Wide Angle) - f/3.5 (Telephoto) aperture. By incorporating a UD (Ultra Low Dispersion) lens into the lens element, the chromatic aberration has been reduced. This model incorporates an image stabilizer, which reduces the effects of camera shake while shooting. In addition, the zoom lens\'s super-smooth, super-fast ultra sonic motor (USM) provides all the zooming speed you need.This camera can take VGA (640 x 480 pixels) movies with exceptional image quality at a full 30 frames per second. Furthermore, it can shoot movies even in the still image shooting modes and vice versa. Also, a new mode to take very smooth QVGA (320 x 240 pixels) movies at 60 frames per second has been newly added. Moreover, digital zoom and manual focus are available as well as adjusting the zoom or exposure, or locking the AF or exposure while shooting a movie. Movies can be taken continuously (depending on the storage capacity of the recording media) until the clip size reaches 1GB or the clip length reaches 1 hour.The recording pixels include a "Widescreen" feature that has the same aspect ratio as 16:9 widescreen TVs for shooting wide images. Adding ISO [800] has resulted in a faster shutter speed even when shooting in dark environments. Also, [High ISO Auto] that has a program diagram with a higher ISO speed setting has been added to the ISO speed position.Featuring "Sports" as a shooting mode has resulted in better focusing of moving subjects, which is especially useful when shooting sporting events. A "My Colors" mode that changes image colors when shooting has been added to the FUNC. Menu of the PowerShot S3 IS.Macro mode is used to record subjects at close range, and Super Macro is used when the distance from the front of the lens to the subject is in the range of 0 to 10 cm (0 to 3.9 in.).This camera is equipped with an upgraded 2.0-inch Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). Information display on the LCD monitor and LCD viewfinder when shooting can be customized. The function (shooting mode: P/Tv/Av/M) to display the histogram when shooting was added and Grid lines can be displayed for easier photo composition. Also, this camera shows the possible shooting range within which auto-focusing at the current zoom position.As the recording quality is set up to 16 bit, 44.100 k Hz with the stereo microphone, high quality recording is possible when shooting movies. In addition, "Sound Recorder" can record sound only, without images.Using My Colors, effects can be added to images that have already been shot (still images only). The functions to create a folder to store recorded images by shooting date or shooting month, and to jump to the first image of each shooting date or to a movie and play have been newly added. Transition effects can be applied while transitioning between scenes or on slide shows.A Print/Share button has also been equipped, letting you easily print your images by connecting the camera directly to a direct print compatible printer and then simply pressing this button. When the camera is connected to a computer, pressing the Print/Share button lets you easily download images directly from the camera to the computer.\nProduct Highlights Video\nProduct Identifiers BrandCanon ModelS3 IS MPN1101B001\nKey Features Camera TypePoint & Shoot Optical Zoom12x Digital Zoom4x Sensor Resolution6.0 MP Screen Size2"\nOptical Sensor Sensor Size1/2.5" Sensor TypeCCD\nLens System Macro Focus Range0-50cm Focus AdjustmentAutomatic, Manual Auto Focus typeTTL contrast detection Focal Length Equivalent to 35mm Camera36 - 432mm\nExposure Max Shutter Speed1/3200 sec Min Shutter Speed15 sec Exposure compensation±2 EV range, in 1/3 EV steps Exposure MeteringCenter-Weighted, Evaluative, Spot, spot AF area Exposure ModesAperture-Priority, Automatic, Manual, Program, Shutter-Priority Light SensitivityISO 100, ISO 200, ISO 400, ISO 80, ISO 800, ISO auto Light Sensitivity Max800\nCamera Flash Flash TypePop-up Flash Red Eye ReductionYes Effective Flash Range0.5 m - 5.2 m Camera Flash FeaturesAF Illuminator, Auto Flash, Flash +/- Compensation, Flash Off, Red-eye Reduction Flash Flash ModesAuto Mode, Auto Mode With Red-eye Reduction, Fill-in Mode, Flash ON Mode, OFF mode, Rear Curtain Sync, Red-eye Reduction, Slow Synchro\nMemory / Storage Supported Flash MemoryMultiMediaCard, SD Card, SD Memory Card, SDHC Memory Card\nViewfinder Viewfinder TypeElectronic, Optical (Through-the-lens) Viewfinder - Field Coverage100% Viewfinder Diagonal Size0.33" Dioptric Correction Range-5.5 to +1.5\nDimensions Depth2.97 in.

This first-class sensor features many of the same technologies used by professional Canon cameras to maximize each pixel's light-gathering efficiency and has center pixels that aid in the EOS Rebel T5i's accurate AF performance. This APS-C size sensor creates an effective 1.6x field of view (compared to 35mm format).\nISO 100-12800 and expandable to 25600 in H mode:\nThanks to its DIGIC 5 Image Processor, the EOS Rebel T5i features an expanded ISO range of ISO 100-12800 (expandable to 25600 in H mode) that makes shooting possible in situations previously unthinkable without flash. The EOS Rebel T5i, with the DIGIC 5 Image Processor's remarkable noise-reduction technology, performs brilliantly in low-light shooting. Used with one of Canon's EF or EF-S lenses with Optical Image Stabilizer, the EOS Rebel T5i can record beautiful images even when light sources are scarce.\nDIGIC 5 Image Processor:\nThe EOS Rebel T5i's DIGIC 5 Image Processor works with the camera's CMOS sensor to deliver images with incredible detail in more situations, without the need for artificial light sources. With the power of the DIGIC 5 Image Processor, the EOS Rebel T5i can achieve higher ISO sensitivity, can shoot up to 5.0 fps continuously and can even perform advanced functions like HDR Backlight Control, art filters, lens correction and much more. The camera's brilliant imaging core supercharges every facet of still and moving image capture.\nHigh-speed continuous shooting:\nThe EOS Rebel T5i can shoot up to 5.0 frames per second, continuously. Thanks to the enhanced shutter mechanism, mirror drive and camera sensor, the EOS Rebel T5i is ready for action; whether capturing that perfect expression, the game's winning goal, or the bride walking down the aisle, the EOS Rebel T5i delivers the speed and performance to guarantee results.\nExceptional autofocus performance and Hybrid CMOS AF:\nThe EOS Rebel T5i is equipped with AF features that ensure speedy, accurate and continuous AF every time. When shooting through the viewfinder, the EOS Rebel T5i has advanced autofocus with a 9-point, all cross-type AF system (including a high-precision dual-cross f/2.8 center point) for accurate focus whether the camera is oriented in portrait or landscape position. An AI Servo AF system achieves and maintains consistent focus with an exceptional degree of reliability.\nThe EOS Rebel T5i also features Canon's amazing Hybrid CMOS AF System, perfect for shooting photos and video in Live View. This system combines two distinct AF technologies, phase and contrast detection AF, for speedier and more accurate focus. These complementary focusing systems are aided by pixels on the camera's CMOS sensor that assist in predicting subject location, making continuous focus tracking quick and accurate in video recording while enhancing focusing speed.\nEOS Full HD Movie Mode with Movie Servo AF:\nThe EOS Rebel T5i offers easy-to-use, professional video capture without compromise. It enables easy manual control of exposure, focus and Live View features, even in-camera editing! Movie Servo AF allows continuous autofocus tracking of moving subjects while recording video.\nCANON iMAGE GATEWAY Qualified:\nAn online resource offering digital imaging education and photo and video sharing capabilities exclusively for registered owners of qualified Canon products.
